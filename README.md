# bestbuy-queue-automation
Simple Tampermonkey script for automating Best Buy's product queue.

# Instructions
Install the script through the TamperMonkey extension for Chrome or the GreaseMonkey extension for Firefox.  
[Copy the contents of the script here as a new script into the above extensions](https://github.com/albert-sun/bestbuy-queue-automation/blob/main/script.js).  
- The script automatically runs on page load (a red-orange banner should appear)
- You have to press the initial "Add to Cart" button and notice the banner change.
- At that point, when the queue pops the button will automatically click, play a sound, and open the cart window!
